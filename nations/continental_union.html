                <p>The <i>Continental Union</i>, often simply the Union, is a presidential republic located largely on North Erikson with a series of territories within the Pacific Ocean. It makes up the majority of the continent, being only bordered by Not-Canada in the North and Not-Mexico in the South. </p>
                <p>It is an industrialized nation with a large population, most of which is located on either the Western or Eastern coastline, with the central regions being largely sparsely populated outside of a few major cities and used for agricultural production. The economy of the Federation is largely import-based, with the largest exports being services and high-tech industries.</p>
                <p>Due to its large economic base, population, advanced technologies produced in and by itself, as well as numerous forward bases, it is the premier superpower on Tellus. It also maintains the second largest and most capable fleet, though a majority of it is destroyed, damaged or otherwise unavailable after the Oceans became unnavigable.</p>
                <p>Internationally, it is in a Cold War with <a href="./not_china">Not-China</a> and maintains a loose network of alliances with the <a href="./state_of_ajisai">State of Ajisai</a> and several nations in Occidentia.</p>
