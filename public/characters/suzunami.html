                <p>Suzunami (すずなみ) is an <a href="/nations/state_of_ajisai">Ajisain</a> shipgirl and a minor character in the story of Keen Sword. She is a smaller destroyer and wears a navy blue sailor-style sweater with a white shirt and a long red skirt. She has large rounded glasses and a black beret with a feather attached to it. There are several smaller golden pins on her hat. Her eyes are orange to ember in shade.</p>
                <p>She is very polite and literate and keeps a large diary with her in which she keeps notes about everything, said diary having visible signs of heavy use, multiple sticky notes, and some water damage. In her diary, she also secretly writes poetry about other ships, the ocean, waves, and the weather, though she rarely shows this to anyone and has burned some of it multiple times over.</p>
                <p>Suzunami also thinks the ocean is "watching" her but refuses to talk about it with anyone. Part of this being her paranoia that her predecessor was sunk in only 5 months during the Global War, which is also the reason she thinks she can predict torpedoes.</p>
