<p>Oh well, good to see you here. You are at the very far edge because I haven't actually written any posts yet! Currently, this is just a test implementation until I get to write some actual blog posts further down the line. The entire system is already there, but I need to wait for faxeon to finish some of her stuff before I can actually write stuff down.</p>
<p>Actually, now thinking about itâ€¦ Why are you here? I am pretty sure the page is indexed by google, but I didn't really expect anyone to visit here so early. Maybe I just send you a link, though, so who really knows? I suppose you do, but I am in the past, and so I do not. Yea, thinking about it, time is somewhat of a weird thing, isn't it? Not even getting into like timezone and stuff just in general, feels pretty weird to think about.</p>
<br>
<p>For the future I will probably leave this up as a hidden <b>Post #0</b> for anyone that fancies finding stuff like this, but for now this is really the only thing I can show on this site.</p>
<br>
<p>Actually, I lied. I can actually put some stuff up here! This is my website, dammit! Let's think about what though.. hmm.. Oh I got an idea.. why don't I just put the stuff here I am listening to right now.</p>
<p><i>*various weird noises as I scroll through the backend of the internet*</i></p>
<p>Alright, so <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhIxg6_Femo"><i>Only My Railgun</i></a> is blaring on my headphones, which I think is pretty cool. A certain scientific railgun/magical index is pretty cool in general, you should go watch it.</p>

<p>Earlier today, someone also sent me this meme:</p>
<img src="/images/meme_transphobes.jpg" alt="A funny meme about the Saratoga">
<p>I think it is pretty accurate. For anyone unaware, that is the Saratoga (CV-3), a Lexington-Class Aircraft Carrier of the US. It, and its sister ship, the Lexington herself, were planned as a set of battlecruisers but were recommissioned as carriers due to the London Naval Treaty (unless I am just imagining things and am fighting the shadow demons at the moment).</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope you have a good day if you read this :3</p>
