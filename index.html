        <p>Izumo was the first character to be created. She is an orange fox with brown paws and large, white ears. She wears a gray hoodie with a yellow zipper line similar to her real-life counterpart's deck-markings, as well as a white serafuku with a red collar, and a red skirt. Additionally, she can normally be seen wearing a pair of white socks.</p>
