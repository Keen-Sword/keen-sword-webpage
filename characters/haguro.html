                <p>Haguro is an <a href="/nations/state_of_ajisai">Ajisain</a> shipgirl and a major assisting character in the story of Keen Sword. She is often shown together with her sister <a href="./maya">Maya</a>. Haguro has crimson red eyes, dark hair and a dark blonde fur color. The fur around her eyes is considerably darker while her snout is nearly white. Her tail is the same color as her hair, somewhat stubby and usually pretty uncombed.</p>
                <p>She, similar to her sister, wears a grey long-sleeve zip-up jacket with white cuffs and darker grey accents at the hem, together with a simple blue miniskirt and white thigh-high socks with red lace garters. Around her tail she has a white band.</p>
                <p>She is very nationalistic and particularly hostile towards Not-China and epically toward <a href="./lhasa.html">Lhasa</a>. However, she is also playful, as can be seen by her pet helicopter, and while trying to act serious most of the time, it is rather easy to see that she is not like that naturally.</p>
