                <p>Izumo is an <a href="/nations/state_of_ajisai">Ajisai</a>n shipgirl and one of the main protagonists in the story of Keen Sword. She has a distinct appearance with her orange and white fur, large fluffy tail and exposed fang on her right side. This makes her look similar to her sister <a href="./kaga">Kaga</a>.</p>
                <p>Her eyes range from dark blue to a lighter blue, while her hair is a dark gray and relatively long where it ends naturally. The fox ears she has have a lighter shade than her other hair and have a moderate amount of fluff in them. She also has a pair of dark brown paws.</p> 
                <p>Usually, she wears a gray hoodie together with a white-red serafuku, a long red plated skirt, and a pair of white knee-high socks. The zipper line on her hoodie is highlighted in yellow with a pair of dashed white lines on either side, and her serafuku has an anchor printed on it. However, she has also been depicted wearing a pink kimono on occasion.</p>
                <p>Her personality is very open and adaptable, as she is always eager to learn new things and interact with new people. It is also somewhat playful, but she is also a gap moe.</p>
