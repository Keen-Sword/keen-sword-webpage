                <p>San Francisco is a shipgirl of the <a href="/nations/continental_union">Continental Union</a> with brown eyes and hair. The hair has shoulder-length and very voluminous, curling inward towards her cheeks.</p>
                <p>Normally, she wears a simple dark swimsuit underneath with a blue seifuku and a red bow, which also has a small golden bell on top of it. Additionally, she has a set of fake pink catears with a white inlet and a similar fake pink tail.</p>
                <p>She is a weeb who has never been to <a href="/nations/state_of_ajisai">Ajisai</a> and, as a result, thinks it is exactly like the anime she watches. However, she has met <a href="/characters/kaga">Kaga</a> before and has a crush on her.</p>
