                <p>Maya (まや) is an <a href="/nations/state_of_ajisai">Ajisain</a> shipgirl and a major assisting character in the story of Keen Sword. She is often shown together with her sister <a href="./haguro">Haguro</a>. Maya's eye range from a dark green the lime with blonde hair and catears. Her tail is the same color as her hair.</p>
                <p>She, similar to her sister, wears a grey long-sleeve zip-up jacket with white cuffs and darker grey accents at the hem, together with a simple blue miniskirt and white thigh-high socks with red lace garters.</p>
                <p>She is as playful as Haguro but unlike her doesn't try to obscure it by trying to act serious. As a result, she is often goofing around or poking fun at her friends, something that is sometimes problematic as the smaller Destroyers like <a href="./suzunami.html">Suzunami</a> see her as a large sister.</p>

            <h4>Haguro</h4>
            <p><a href="./haguro">Haguro</a> is Maya's sister. They argue about nearly everything, even things they agree on, just to keep the argument going. Despite that, they always back each other up.</p>
            <h4>Izumo-chan</h4>
            <p>She and <a href="./izumo">Izumo</a> serve in the same fleet and are good friends. Both refer to each other with -chan.</p>
            <h4>Lhasa</h4>
            <p>Maya and <a href="./lhasa">Lhasa</a> are distant with her intentionally disrepecting her on several occasions. However, this does not go to the extent as between Lhasa and her sister.</p>
