                <p>Lhasa is an <a href="/nations/chugonia">Chugonese</a> shipgirl and a minor character in the story of Keen Sword. She has medium-length, straight hair colored in a muted purple-brown tone, with one strain of her falling over her shoulder. Her eyes are brown to dark brown but are usually hidden.</p>
                <p>Normally, she wears her long brown coat open with a beige shirt underneath. The coat is long enough to cover her green pleated skirt, showing only her dark pantyhose. She also has a stylized golden hair clip shaped as a phoenix that she is not allowed to wear, but does so anyway. Her coat also has a hood that makes her significantly harder to detect when used, making her face disappear and only showing glowing white eyes.</p>
                <p>She is largely apathetic to the world around her and does not particularly care about others. However, she is also nationalistic and epically likes to annoy <a href="./haguro">Haguro</a> by standing right outside the ajisain border.</p>

            <p>Lhasa and <a href="./haguro">Haguro</a> openly hate each other with both of them constantly trying to annoy and one-up the other. This started as both are nationalistic and had several clashes in the past. As a result, she calls her by the chinese reading of the mountain Haguro is named after.</p>
